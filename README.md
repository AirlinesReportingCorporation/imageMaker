# imageMaker

This application is used to quickly create on brand graphics to be used with social, HR, emails, and more.  Primarily, this uses the Vue.js framework to style the graphic within HTML and then uses the html-to-image library (https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image) to export the DOM node with the edited graphic.
